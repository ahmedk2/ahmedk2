🙋🏽‍♂️ My name is Khalid Ahmed and I am an aspiring Cloud Engineer. Over the last few months I have been learning linux, networking, python and AWS (Amazon Web Services).

🔭 I have 3+ years of experience within application support and a beginner DevOps Engineer.

👏🏾 I enjoy paying it forward which is why I volunteer with organizations like Black Boys Code to be a mentor and help youth with personal growth and learn about the tech industry.
